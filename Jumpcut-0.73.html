        <p>Jumpcut 0.73 is a minor release, adding a new &quot;delete single clipping&quot; feature and fixing a small but irritating bug bug.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Improved detection of Jumpcut-created clips to prevent re-adding them to the clipping stack.</li>
            <li>Individual clips may now be deleted by pressing the delete key or backspace when the clip is displayed in the bezel.</li>
        </ul>
