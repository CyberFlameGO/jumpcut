    <h1>Jumpcut: Accessibility</h1>
    <h2>On Accessibility</h2>
    <p>
        Jumpcut requies the use of macOS&rsquo;s Accessibility features
        in order to paste clippings. (Internally, these are done by
        emitting the same events that would occur if you typed Command-V 
        manually. The
        <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Accessibility/Conceptual/AccessibilityMacOSX/OSXAXmodel.html">Accessibility
        features</a> of Macintoshes allow programs to control the behavior
        of other programs, but this requires users to explicitly allow this
        behavior. (This is a standard method used by Mac applications
        such as Jumpcut or the window manager
        <a href="https://github.com/eczarny/spectacle">Spectacle</a> to
        extend native system behavior.)
    </p>

    <h2>Granting Accessibility</h2>
    <p>
        When Jumpcut detects that it does not have these Accessibility
        privileges, it will prompt you when the program first launches,
        asking you to grant them. (There will also be a notification
        in Jumpcut&rsquo;s General Preferences tab, and the
        &ldquo;Clipping Selection Pastes&rdquo; checkbox will be grayed
        out.
    </p>

    <p>
        To grant Accessibility access to Jumpcut:
        <ol>
            <li>Open System Preferences (under the Apple menu).</li>
            <li>Open the Security &amp; Privacy preference pane.</li>
            <li>Choose the Privacy tab, then choose Accessibility.</li>
            <li>
                If necessary, click the lock and enter your password to 
                make changes.
            </li>
            <li>
                If Jumpcut isn't present in the list of applications
                allowed to &ldquo;control your computer&rdquo;, click
                the &ldquo;+&rdquo; button to add it.
            </li>
            <li>Click the checkbox to activate the permission.</li>
            <li>Click the lock to prevent further changes.</li>
        </ol>
    </p>

    <p>
        When successfully added, your Privacy tab should look something
        like this (from High Sierra):<br>

            width="412" height="300">
    </p>

    <h2>Warning to Upgraders</h2>
    <p>
        Multiple users have reported issues with Jumpcut failing to
        paste properly after upgrading from 0.63 to 0.70. Beyond the
        paste function not working, one symptom of this issue is that
        Jumpcut appears in the Accessibility tab of the &ldquo;Security
        and Privacy&rdquo; System Preference with only its icon appearing,
        <em>without</em> the name &rdquo;Jumpcut&ldquo; appearing beside
        it. (<a href="./assets/images/bad-accessibility.png" target="_blank">See
        an example.</a>) If this occurs, click the lock if needed to make
        changes. Highlight the Jumpcut icon and click &ldquo;-&rdquo;
        to remove the bad Accessibility record. Add Jumpcut again following
        the steps given above.
    </p>
    <p>
        The underlying cause for this upgrade behavior isn&rsquo;t currently
        known, but may have something to do with the way in which Jumpcut
        0.63&rsquo;s privileges were granted in the older code.
