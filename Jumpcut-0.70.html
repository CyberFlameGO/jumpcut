        <p>This is the first release of Jumpcut in 10 years, and includes a number of internal changes that will be required to run Jumpcut under versions of macOS Catalina (10.15). Users running versions prior to High Sierra (10.13) should continue to use Jumpcut 0.63. If you're on an old version of Jumpcut that can't update automatically, please visit the new GitHub page, <a href="https://snark.github.io/jumpcut/">https://snark.github.io/jumpcut/</a> and download it there.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>64-bit compatible; required for future versions of macOS</li>
            <li>Updated to reflect modern macOS security practices, including Accessability entitlements, code-hardening, and notarization</li>
            <li>Improved support for paste behavior on non-American keyboards</li>
            <li>Restored &ldquo;Clear All&rdquo; menu item</li>
            <li>Retina-ready &ldquo;Jumpcut logo&rdquo; menu bar icon (now supporting dark mode!)</li>
            <li>Known transient sources of content (such as TypeIt4Me and TextExpander) are now ignored</li>
            <li>Option to ignore known sources of sensitive data, such as KeePassXC or 1Password</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Note that development, including bug reports, has been moved to GitHub. Thanks for using Jumpcut, for however many years you've been using it!</p>
