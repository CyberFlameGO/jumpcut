# Changelog

Jumpcut predates the widespread adoption of semantic versioning; as such,
pre-1.0 releases are numbered as 0.XX.

## Unreleased
### Fixed
- Display resolution changes now trigger adjustments to bezel size and
positioning.
- ShortcutRecorder control was too old to have Mojave styling or Dark Mode
support; some assets have been brought back into the pinned old version
- Removed some blank Info.plist values causing problems in Activity monitor
- Edge case: the hotkey no longer triggers the bezel while setting the hotkey
- Very large clippings (such as Moby Dick) no longer cause discernable lag
time when viewed in the bezel
- Sparkle auto-updater not triggering on launch
### Changed
- Jumpcut now targets versions of macOS 10.11 (Yosemite) and later
- Minimum number of clips to remember is now a more sane 10 instead of 1
