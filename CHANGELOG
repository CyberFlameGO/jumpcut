# Changelog

Jumpcut predates the widespread adoption of semantic versioning; as such,
pre-1.0 releases are numbered as 0.XX.

## UNRELEASED
### Fixed
- Improved detection of Jumpcut-created clips; previously, we were
relying on an exact match between the item on the pasteboard and the
first clip in Jumpcut's stack, which fails to detect items coming from
Jumpcut *not* at the top of the stack. We now set a marker and ignore
any items that Jumpcut has pasted, regardless of their stack position.
### Added
- Individual clips may now be deleted by pressing the delete key or
backspace when the clip is displayed in the bezel.
## [0.72] - 2020-02-20
### Fixed
- Fixed issue preventing default hotkey (Control-Option-V) from being set
for first-time users.
- Jumpcut has updated to use the most recent ShortcutRecorder code
as of February 2020; while the fork previously in use worked correctly
on Macs running 10.13 (High Sierra) and later, a crashing bug was
reported when setting the master hotkey on Sierra (duplicated on El
Capitan). Using the mainline ShortcutRecorder (v3.1, from October 2019)
has resolved this issue on El Capitan, where the hotkey may not be set
normally.
- keyCodeToString crashed when using Hiragana and Katakana keyboards;
this code has been made more defensive and should work more robustly for
non-Roman keyboards. (Update: this change also fixed a similar bug with
Pinyin keyboards.) Thanks to Darren Gore for the initial bug report and
assistance with reproduction and testing.
### Added
- "Bezel selection pastes" and "menu selection pastes" are once again
separate items in the general preferences.

## [0.71] - 2019-09-19
### Fixed
- Display resolution changes now trigger adjustments to bezel size and
positioning, meaning that Jumpcut does not need to be restarted to have
a normal bezel after adding or removing a monitor.
- The version of ShortcutRecorder used by Jumpcut was too old to have Mojave
styling or Dark Mode support; some assets have been brought back from the
upstream project to provide this. Snow Leopard styling has been dropped. The
recorder is now legible in Dark Mode.
- Removed some blank Info.plist values causing problems in Activity Monitor;
Jumpcut was not displaying or displaying with no listed name, just the icon.
- Edge case: typing the active hotkey while _setting_ the hotkey no longer
activates the bezel.
- Very large clippings (such as Moby Dick) no longer cause discernable lag
time when viewed in the bezel
- Sparkle auto-updater now runs properly on launch if the checkbox has been
checked. (Previously, due to a misreading of the Sparkle docs, it was not
activating.)
### Changed
- Jumpcut now targets versions of macOS/OS X 10.11 (El Capitan) and later
- Minimum number of clips to remember is now a more sane 10 instead of 1

## [0.70] - 2019-09-01
### Fixed
- 64-bit compatible; now runs without warning under Mojave
- Corrected behavior for Command-V emission on non-American keyboards
- Known transient sources of content (such as TypeIt4Me and TextExpander) are now ignored
- Rewrote Launch on Login to support modern macOS requirements
### Added
- Restored “Clear All” menu item
- Accessibility entailment for modern macOS security concerns
- Retina-ready “Jumpcut logo” menu bar icon
- Dark mode support for menu bar icon
- Option to ignore known sources of sensitive data, such as KeePassXC or 1Password
### Removed

- Support for pre-High Sierra macOS
- Dropped Credits preference panel in favor of credits embedded in the About
menu

## [0.63] - 2009-01-26
