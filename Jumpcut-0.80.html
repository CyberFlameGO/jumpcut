    <body>
        <p>Jumpcut 0.80 represents a complete rewrite of Jumpcut in Swift 5. The minimum supported version
            of macOS/OS X is now 10.11.</p>
        <p>Additionally, we have a new icon by John Kenzie, and the following new features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>&quot;Headless&quot; mode, where a status bar icon is not displayed. (Double-click
                the Jumpcut icon to reopen Jumpcut's preferences window when headless mode is
                active.)</li>
            <li>&quot;Additional options&quot; in the menu, currently limited to explicit
                copy-to-pasteboard, paste, and delete. This means deleting individual clippings is
                now available without keyboard use.</li>
            <li>&quot;Toggle&quot; behavior in the menu, switching to whichever of copy-to-pasteboard
                or paste is <i>not</i> the current preference.</li>
            <li>&quot;Reset Preferences&quot; button, restoring factory default preferences (and
                removing the necessity of editing settings in the command line to undo &quot;don't
                warn me&quot; again choices).</li>
            <li>Configurable bezel text alignment.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>As always, please report any bugs or feature requests on GitHub. Thanks for using Jumpcut!</p>
