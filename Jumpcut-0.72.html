        <p>Jumpcut 0.72 is a maintenance release, fixing a number of issues (some serious) affecting a subset of users.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Switching between English and certain non-Latin keyboards (Hiragana, Katakana, and Pinyin are known to have been affected) caused Jumpcut to crash in versions 0.70 and 0.71. This bug has been resolved.</li>
            <li>Setting a hotkey in older versions of macOS (El Capitan and Sierra) caused an application crash, although the hotkey was successfully updated. This bug has been resolved, and users of older operating systems may update their hotkeys normally..</li>
            <li>&ldquo;Bezel selection pastes&rdquo; and &ldquo;menu selection pastes&rdquo; are once again separate items in the general preferences.
            <li>Jumpcut was previously not setting the default hotkey of Control-Option-V for new users.</li>
        </ul>
